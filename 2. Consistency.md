# DATA CONSISTENCY

Achieving high consistency in a large scale system can be challenging

---

First of all, if we keep just a single DB server it will result into SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE

Hence, we need multiple DB Servers. This is where we start facing consistency issues

---

There are two type of consistency:

1. Strong Consistency 
    * Every read request returns most up-to-date value
    * Throws error if it can't
2. Eventual Consistency
    * Once data is updated, eventually read requests will return the most updated value

---

### Example: Views counter of Youtube videos (Eventual Consistency)

<img src="images/datareplication.png" alt="Image description" width="500" height="300">

STRONG CONSISTENCY
* Low performance and Availability

EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY
* Sometimes seeing stale values

We have to consider that which one of them will have least amount of impact on the users

Here, for youtube views counter we can afford stale vvalue of number of views since itis not impacting the user experience




### Example: Stock price (Strong consistency)

Here we cannot afford to show stale prices since it will negatively impact the users. 
* Hence, we prefer strong consistency here over high performance
