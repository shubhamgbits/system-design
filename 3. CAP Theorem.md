# CAP Theorem

---
CAP Theorem states that distributed datastores can provider atmost two of the following three properties 

| | | | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| C | Consistency | Every read receives most up-to-date value OR an error. </br>It should never return stale or inconsistent data |
| A | Availability | Every request receive a valid response. It might return stale values but NO ERRORS | 
| P | Partition Tolerance | Partition refers to network partition which is break in communication between the nodes. </br> Two nodes are up and running but can no longer communicate with each other. </br><u>Example</u>: Replica DB Architecture. </br></br> Partition tolerance means designing the System which can function correctly despite network failures |

### It can never provide simultaneously all 3

But we really can't sacrifice partition tolerance

Hence, the real choince is between consistency and availability
